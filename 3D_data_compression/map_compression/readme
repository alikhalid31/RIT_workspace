1-append-frame_name
	append the name of frame as an additional attribute to all the points
2-find_closest_frame 
	find the closest frame in the reference data for all the frames in the data under considereration 
3-build_map 
	build a map from individual frames
4-map_compression
	comopress the data by building a map for reference_day and compress_dat and then performing diff operation 
4a-map_compression
	use reference_day to find the points_to_add and points_to_remove frame by frame
4a2-map_compression
	use reference_day to find the points_to_add and points_to_remove frame by frame and then convert some of the points in points to add to to index using basemap
4b-map_compression_octree
